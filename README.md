# Text - To - Speech

This app lets you convert text into speech! You can type any text into the provided text area, and hit the "Speak" button to hear your text spoken aloud. It's a fun way to experiment and hear your words come to life. Plus, you can control the speaking process with the play/pause button. It's like having your own virtual narrator at your fingertips!

The app works with Czech language syntezis.
